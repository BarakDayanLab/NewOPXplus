        Forces the given variables to be used by the given element thread. Useful as a workaround for when the compiler
        wrongly assigns variables which can cause gaps.
        To be used at the beginning of a program, will add a 16ns wait to the given element. Use an `align()` if needed.

        Example::

            >>> with program() as program_name:
            >>>     a = declare(int)
            >>>     b = declare(fixed)

            >>>     ...
